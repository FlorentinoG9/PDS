### Programming, and Data Structures
#### Workbook 0 | Setup Object-Oriented

Remember to keep your lab work organized so you can use if for revision and make it easy to submit. 
1.	Write a program in a file called **Average.java** that uses an array that holds the percentage mark for 20 students. Have the program call a method to calculate the average mark obtained by those students. 
2.	Write a program in a file called **Insert.java** that uses an array to hold 20 values. Have the program call a method to insert a value into the array at a specific array location. Use a loop to ensure that you can insert several items and print the array after each insertion to view the result. 
3.	Write a program called **LinearSearch.java** that uses an array to hold 20 values. Populate the array. Have the program call a method to carry out a linear search of the array that returns the location of the search item in the array if it is found, or â€“1 if the search item is not in the array. 
4.	Using your Linear Search implementation from Question 3 change the algorithm to pass the item searched to the top of the list after each call. Why is this useful?

> Note

- Using your IDE generate a new project called <lastname>_<firstname>_<studentnumber>_<workbook0>  e.g. kohlmann_stephen_1234567_workbook0
- Use the default package
- Create 3 java files with the names above.
- Discuss how you intend to write your programme with your partner before you write it. 
- Draw out a picture of the array data structure and how you plan to use it, drawing helps maintain focus and improves memory. 
- Ensure the following 
  - Each file contains a class with the same names as the java file name 
  - Each class contains a constructor. 
  - The constructor calls the super() method. 
  - All method in the class are public
  - All classes have a main method which tests the public methods. 
  - Comments
    - Each method has a comment describing what the method does in the following format /** **/
    - Any complex line has its own comment //
