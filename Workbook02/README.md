Tasks

1. **Stack.java** Implement a Stack in Java. Use an array. Your stack should have push, pop, isFull, isEmpty and top methods. You can choose what the parameters & return type of these functions are. In your main method use each of the methods, and test out your Stack. The Stack should be able to store integers. N.B. What should the difference between pop and top be?  
2. **NaiveQueue.java** Implement and test our naïve Queue approach, as discussed in the lecture notes. Create enQueue, deQueue, isEmpty, isFull methods, and test them in the main method.
3. **CircularQueue.java** Implement and test our Circular Queue approach, also discussed in the lecture notes. Create enqueue, dequeue, isEmpty, isFull methods, and test them in the main method.
