### Programming, and Data Structures

#### Workbook 4 | Sorting Algorithms

This worksheet WILL be graded. Be sure to use the Class template design provided in Average.java from Workbook0.

Today’s lab is about searching for data in linear data structures. We are going to implement what we saw in the lecture notes. For each part, create an array of integer data yourselves. For Part3.java, make sure that your array is already sorted (remember, Binary Search only works on sorted data).

Before you begin.

- Ensure that your workspace is in a folder which is backed up to the web/ network e.g. college network drive, google drive. You may like to have it in the following folder structure …/GriffithCollege/PDS/workspace
- Load Eclipse selecting the appropriate workspace
- Make a new java project called Workbook03
- Make a new package in this project called workbook03
- Make a 3 new java files with the name provided below.

  > COMMENT YOUR CODE!!!!!!! SERIOUSLY. I CANNOT GIVE MARKS IF YOU DON’T
  > EXPLAIN WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

> Today’s lab is about sorting data in linear data structures. We are going to implement what we saw in the lecture notes. For each part, create an array of unsorted integer data yourselves.
> Download the Array Structures Skelteon template from Moodle and implement the sorting algorithms below.

Tasks

1. SelectionSort Create an array of integer data and sort it using the Selection Sort algorithm. Your method should be called selectionSort(), and should be invoked on the object newArray provided in the skeleton code. Test your method by invoking the method on the object. Ensure your output is clear.

2. InsertionSort Create an array of integer data and sort it using the Insertion Sort algorithm. Your method should be called insertionSort(), and should be invoked on the object newArray provided in the skeleton code. Test your method by invoking the method on the object. Ensure your output is clear.

3. BubbleSort Create an array of integer data and sort it using Bubble Sort. Your method should be called bubblesort(), and should be invoked on the object newArray provided in the skeleton code. Test your method by invoking the method on the object. Ensure your output is clear.
