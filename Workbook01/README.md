### Programming, and Data Structures
##### Workbook 1 | Object-Oriented Programming

This worksheet is to help you become familiar with the basics of

- Projects – creating and naming them 
- Packages – creating and naming them
- Classes – creating, naming, calling, file naming 
- Constructors – declaring, calling, naming
- Methods – declaring, calling, naming
- Variables – declaring, initializing, referencing 

This worksheet WILL be graded. Be sure to use the Class template design provided in Average.java from Workbook0.

***Before you begin.*** 

1. Ensure that your workspace is in a folder which is backed up to the web/ network e.g. college network drive, google drive. You may like to have it in the following folder structure …/GriffithCollege/PDS/workspace
2. Load Eclipse selecting the appropriate workspace
3. Make a new java project called Workbook01
4. Make a new package in this project called workbook01
5. Make a 8 new java files with the name provided below.

**Tasks**

> *Where the OOD approach is specified use a separate test class to create your objects.*

1. **Odd.java** Write a program that takes an integer input and prints an output messages stating whether or not the user enters an odd positive number. 
2. **GreaterThan.java** Write a program with a main method that calls a method called greaterThan, that takes two integer arguments and returns 1, if the first is greater than the second, and 0 otherwise. 
3. **Guessing.java** and **GuessingTest.java**: *Use OOD*: Write a number guessing program. Assign a value to a variable called number at the top of the program. Give a prompt that asks for five guesses. See whether any of the guesses matches the number and then print an appropriate message if one does. Your solution should have two classes.
4. **Tax.java** and **TaxTest.java**: *Use OOD*:  Write a tax calculation program. Prompt the user to input two salaries for a family and output their combined tax bill. A family pays no tax if its income is less than 15000 euro. The family pays a 10% tax if the combined salaries are for 15000 euro through 19,999 euro, or a 20% tax if the combined salaries are from 20000 euro through 29,999. Otherwise, the family pays a 30% tax. Your solution should have two classes.
5. **Initals.java** and **InitialsTest.java** : *Use OOD*:  Write a program that asks the user for two initials. Print a message telling the user whether the first initial falls alphabetically before the second. Your solution should have two classes.
